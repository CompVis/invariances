                <h1>Abstract</h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
To tackle increasingly complex tasks, it has become an essential ability of
neural networks to learn abstract representations. These task-specific
representations and, particularly, the invariances they capture turn neural
networks into black box models that lack interpretability. To open such a
black box, it is, therefore, crucial to uncover the different semantic
concepts a model has learned as well as those that it has learned to be
invariant to. We present an approach based on INNs that
(i) recovers the task-specific, learned invariances by disentangling the
remaining factor of variation in the data and that
(ii) invertibly transforms these recovered invariances combined with the
model representation into an equally expressive one with accessible semantic
concepts.
As a consequence, neural network representations
become understandable by providing the means to (i) expose their semantic
meaning, (ii) semantically modify a representation, and (iii) visualize
individual learned semantic concepts and invariances. Our invertible approach
significantly extends the abilities to understand black box models by
enabling post-hoc interpretations of state-of-the-art networks without
compromising their performance.

Proposed architecture. We provide post-hoc interpretation for a given deep network f = Ψ ◦ Φ. For a deep representation z = Φ(x) a conditional INN t recovers Φ’s invariances v from a representation z̄ which contains entangled information about both z and v. The INN e then translates the representation z̄ into a factorized representation with accessible semantic concepts. This approach allows for various applications, including visualizations of network representations of natural and altered inputs, semantic network analysis and semantic image modifications.

Comparison to existing network inversion methods for AlexNet. In
contrast to the methods of [13] (D&B) and [39] (M&V), our invertible method
explicitly samples the invariances of Φ w.r.t. the data, which circumvents a
common cause for artifacts and produces natural images independent of the depth
of the layer which is reconstructed. The bottom row shows FID scores for layer
visualizations of AlexNet, obtained with our method and [13] (D&B).

Visualizing FGSM adversarial attacks on ResNet-101. To the human eye, the original image and its attacked version are almost indistinguishable. However, the input image is correctly classified as ”siamese cat”, while the attacked version is classified as ”mountain lion”. Our approach visualizes how the attack spreads throughout the network. Reconstructions of representations of attacked images demonstrate that the attack targets the semantic content of deep layers. The variance of z̄ explained by v combined with these visualizations show how increasing invariances cause vulnerability to adversarial attacks.

Revealing texture bias in ImageNet classifiers. We compare visualizations of z from the penultimate layer of ResNet-50 trained on standard ImageNet (left) and a stylized version of ImageNet (right). On natural images (rows 1-3) both models recognize the input, removing textures through stylization (rows 4-6) makes images unrecognizable to the standard model, however it recognizes objects from textured patches (rows 7-9). Rows 10-12 show that a model without texture bias can be used for sketch-to-image synthesis.

Analyzing the degree to which different semantic concepts are captured by a network representation changes as training progresses. For SqueezeNet on ColorMNIST we measure how much the data varies in different semantic concepts ei and how much of this variability is captured by z at different training iterations. Early on z is sensitive to foreground and background color, and later on it learns to focus on the digit attribute. The ability to encode this semantic concept is proportional to the classification accuracy achieved by z. At training iterations 4k and 36k we apply our method to visualize model representations and thereby illustrate how their content changes during training.

Additional z conditional samples after 4k and 36k training steps, as in the
previous figure. Each row is conditioned on z = Φ(x) and each column is conditioned on a v ∼ N (v|0, 1). At 4k (resp. 36k) iterations, z explains 2.57% (resp. 36.08%) of the variance in the digit factor. Thus, the digit class of samples obtained at 4k iterations change with the sampled invariances across columns, while it stays the same at 36k iterations. Conversely, at 4k (resp. 36k) iterations, z explains 38.44% (resp. 2.76%) of the variance in the background color factor. Thus, the background color of samples obtained at 4k iterations change with the sampled representation z = Φ(x) across rows, while it stays the same at 38k iterations.

left : Visualizing FaceNet representations and their invariances. Sampling multiple reconstructions x̄ = D(t−1(v|z)) shows the degree of invariance learned by different layers. The invariance w.r.t. pose increases for deeper layers as expected for face identification. Surprisingly, FaceNet uses glasses as an identity feature throughout all its layers as evident from the spatial mean and variance plots, where the glasses are still visible. This reveals a bias and weakness of the model. right : Spatially averaged variances over multiple x for different layers.

Shifting domains: Human faces to animal faces evaluated with a fixed FaceNet. The evaluation procedure is similar to the method described in Fig. 3. Although never trained on data consisting of something else than human faces, FaceNet is able to capture the ”identity” of the input to a certain degree. Information about appearance is approximately preserved until the last layer, i.e. the final identity embedding.

Semantic Modifications on CelebA. In each column, we replace a semantic factor
ei(E(x)) by e ∗ i , which is obtained from another, randomly chosen, image that
differs in the corresponding attribute. Subsequently we decode a semantically
modified image using the invertibility of e to obtain x̄∗ = D(e−1((e∗i ))). The
results of StarGAN [8] are obtained by negating the binary value for the
column’s attribute. FID scores in next figure.

Semantic Modifications on CelebA. For each column, after inferring the semantic factors (ei)i = e(E(x)) of the input x, we replace one factor ei by that from another randomly chosen image that differs in this concept. The inverse of e translates this semantic change back into a modified z̄, which is decoded to a semantically modified image. Distances between FaceNet embeddings before and after modification demonstrate its sensitivity to differences in gender and glasses.
